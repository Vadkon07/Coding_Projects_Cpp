Hi, bro!

You can use these C++ coding projects for your self education as examples.
These codes are very different, from legendary "Hello, World" to request forms which can be saved in .txt.

If you have any ideas how can I improve these codes (or if you improved them), send a message to my email vadkonbeats@gmail.com

Here I just publish all my projects (and even yours, if you send them to me) which in my opinion can be useful for other coders.

All projects are fully free for use. You can edit them, share them, etc.
