Hi bro!

You can use these C++ coding projects for your self education as examples.
These codes are very different, from legendary "Hello, World" to request forms which can be saved in .txt.

If you have any ideas how can I improve these codes (or if you improved them), send a message to my email vadkonbeats@gmail.com
