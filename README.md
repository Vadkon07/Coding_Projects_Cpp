Hi bro!

You can use these C++ coding projects for your self education as examples.
These codes are very different, from legendary "Hello, World" to request forms which can be saved in .txt.

If you have any ideas how can I improve these codes (or if you improved them), send a message to my email vadkonbeats@gmail.com

When I was writing this text (2024-06-14), I had a very small experience in C++, only for around 3-4 days. So, these codes are sooo easy for everyone!
